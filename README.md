Validates credentials and provides a JWT token

Jyothi, I didn't end up finding time to wire this service up to our /users microservice. If you can take a look, need to create a JWT token when its called upon.

Try setting it up this way -> https://dzone.com/articles/spring-boot-security-json-web-tokenjwt-hello-world
Should be straightforward.
